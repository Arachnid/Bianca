I. What is Quercus ?
-----------------------------------------------------
Quercus is Caucho Technologyâ€™s fast, open-source, 100% Java implementation of the PHP language.


II. Why a development branch maintained by Clever Cloud ?
-----------------------------------------------------
Clever Cloud has copied the Quercus project, maintained and copyrighted by Caucho Technology, to have a best response for issues and features requests. Quercus is a part of Caucho's project Resin.
You can find the Git-port of Caucho's SVN here : http://github.com/Kdecherf/resin

Just launch ant and wait ;-)

V. Report an issue
