I. What is Quercus ?
-----------------------------------------------------
Caucho's Quercus (TM) is a fast, 100% Java implementation of the PHP language
allowing developers to use PHP flexibility for the web interface and Java for
stability.


II. Why a development branch maintained by Clever Cloud ?
-----------------------------------------------------
Clever Cloud has copied the Quercus project, maintained and copyrighted by
Caucho Technology, to have a best response for issues fixing and features
requests. Quercus is a part of Caucho's project Resin.
You can find the Git-port of Caucho's SVN here :
http://github.com/Kdecherf/resin


III. Compiling

anything.
